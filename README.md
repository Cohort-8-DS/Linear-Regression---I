# Linear-Regression-I

You have two assignments for the day. The first one is to get more comfortable with data cleaning and visualization. The second is to practice your linear regression. 

Instructions for the first assignment are in the Data_clean_viz notebook. 

For the second assignment you need to use the gas_consumption.xlsx. Here one of the columns (unlabeled) is gas conumption and your task is to predict gas consumption using the variables. The description of the data is in the data_description.txt
